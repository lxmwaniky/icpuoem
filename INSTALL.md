# Developer Environment Setup

A developer environment consists of tools and packages that are required to develop code projects. Usually, developer environments are stored and hosted on your local computer, but there are some situations where a virtual, web-based development environment exists.

## Setting up a Developer Environment
1. Confirm you have a connection to the internet

2. Confirm you have access to a command line interface (CLI) on your local macOS or Linux computer
    > Open a command line interface (CLI) window. This may be referred to as 'Terminal' or 'Shell' depending on your computer's operating system

3. Download and install the latest version of dfxvm with the following command:
    ```bash
    sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"
    ```
